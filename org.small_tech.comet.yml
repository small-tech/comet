  # The app uses host permissions instead of home permissions to support projects
  # mounted as external drives and network shares. As mount points can (and do)
  # differ, it makes sense to use host permissions to ensure that all such projects
  # work instead of attempting to compile a list of all popular mount points to
  # support.
  #
  # In terms of security, what matters is whether an app has home permissions or not
  # since, once an app has home permissions, it can easily escape the sandbox and
  # run arbitrary code and even escalate its own Flatpak permissions (as the settings
  # file is kept within the person’s home directory).
  #
  # As the threat model here assumes that either that the app author is malicious
  # or that the app’s source repository has been compromised and modified by
  # a malicious actor, the use of granular filesystem permissions on an app that
  # already has home permissions is security theatre.
  #
  # In this scenario, the real security in the system is not provided by the
  # Flatpak sandbox but by the following two properties of the system:
  #
  # 1. The app being free and open source.
  #
  # 2. The extent to which the automated and manual reviews of the source code, as
  #    carried out by the elementary OS app review team, can catch malicious behaviour.
